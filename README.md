# 💫 About Me:
Software & Data Engineer working at the intersection of engineering and customer-facing systems. My experience includes L1/L2-style SaaS support: triaging issues, debugging APIs and data workflows, validating data with SQL, collaborating with engineering on root-cause analysis, and documenting fixes to reduce repeat incidents.

I build scalable backend systems, data pipelines, and automation workflows using Python, SQL, and AWS, with a strong focus on reliability, observability, and production readiness.
# 🛠 Support & Troubleshooting Experience:
• Investigated and resolved production issues including API failures, schema drift, data inconsistencies, and batch orchestration errors.

• Used SQL and logs to validate data correctness and identify root causes.

• Worked closely with engineering teams to distinguish configuration issues from true product defects.

• Documented fixes and process improvements to reduce repeat incidents.
